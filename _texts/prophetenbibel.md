## Overview

The Prophets Bible of 1529 was a landmark in the work of the Zurich church under Zwingli to produce a complete translation of the whole Bible. The full Zurich Bible appeared in 1531, shortly before Zwingli’s death. The publication of the Prophets Bible was a response to other translations prepared by radical reformers. The major theme of Zwingli’s preface is the nature of prophecy and the nature of the prophetic office as model for the preaching of ministers. The preface is one of Zwingli’s most extensive treatment of prophecy and the prophets, which were central to his understanding of the pastoral office in Zurich. Zwingli’s understanding of prophecy and the prophetic office was foundational for the Reformed tradition.

## Background

Beginning in 1525 the Zurich church, under Zwingli’s leadership began work on a translation of the Bible into German for the people. Luther’s New Testament was widely used, but the language was difficult for the Swiss to understand as they spoke Alemannic, a form of German significantly different from Luther’s Saxon dialect. Some efforts had been made to accommodate Luther’s translation for the Swiss, but the goal was to prepare a Bible in their native tongue. Work began in June 1525 with the founding of the Prophezei in the Grossmünster in Zurich. Almost every day of the week, Zwingli and his colleagues would gather to work on the books of the Old Testament, beginning with Genesis. The biblical texts were read in Hebrew, Greek (Septuagint), and Latin (Vulgate) and interpreted by the Zurich scholars. The sessions were intended to be open to the clergy, but as they were in Latin only a few could attend. The work of the Prophezei was to serve the church, and to that end at the end of each meeting Zwingli’s close friend, Leo Jud, would take the fruits of the work and deliver them in a German sermon. 

The preparation of a Swiss German Bible took many years, culminating in the Zurich Bible of 1531, the first complete translation into German of the whole Bible. It appeared three years before Luther’s German Bible of 1534. Parts of the new translation were printed in advance. In March 1529, the printer Froschauer produced the Prophets Bible (Prophetenbibel), a new translation of the prophetic books of the Old Testament. 

The publication of the Prophetenbibel was a hurried response to the appearance in 1527 of the *Alle Propheten / nach Hebraischer sprach verteutschet*, printed in Worms and which became known as the Wormser Prophets. It was the work of two highly accomplished translators, Ludwig Hätzer and Hans Denck, who had been assisted by Jewish rabbis. The translation was much admired, including by Zwingli and Luther, although they were appalled by Hätzer and Denck’s radical, possibly Anabaptist, views. Their book sold well and was frequently reprinted, including in Basel and Zurich by Froschauer. 

Indeed Zwingli and his colleagues made extensive use of the Wormser Prophets in preparing their translation of the prophetic books. Research has shown that whole passages were lifted for use in the Zurich translation. Even where the Zurichers provided their own translations, clearly the Wormser Prophets was extensively consulted. Another reason was haste. The printer Froschauer wanted the Zurich translation to be available for the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1529 and that put huge pressure on the scholars. As a result, they relied heavily on the work of Hätzer and Denck. 

The Prophetenbibel appeared in two forms in 1529. The first was a folio edition that included the prophets together with the books of the Apocrypha and a German New Testament. The second was a much smaller octavo edition with only the translations of the prophets. The difference was not just size. The folio edition contained the text is Swiss German and was intended primarily for the clergy for study and preaching. The octavo was written in the German of the Upper Rhine, signaling its intended readership in German lands. Neither edition was reprinted. The Prophetenbibel was a first step towards the complete Bible that appeared two years later.

## Note on authorship

The author of the preface to the Prophetenbibel is not named, clearly signally that book was to demonstrate the collective work of the Zurich scholars. Nevertheless, it is clear that it was the work of Zwingli.
