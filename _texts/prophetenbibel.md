## Overview

The Prophets Bible of 1529 was a landmark in the work of the Zurich church under Zwingli to produce a complete translation of the whole Bible. The full Zurich Bible appeared in 1531, shortly before Zwingli’s death. The publication of the Prophets Bible was a response to other translations prepared by radical reformers. The major theme of Zwingli’s preface is the nature of prophecy and the nature of the prophetic office as model for the preaching of ministers. The preface is one of Zwingli’s most extensive treatment of prophecy and the prophets, which were central to his understanding of the pastoral office in Zurich. Zwingli’s understanding of prophecy and the prophetic office was foundational for the Reformed tradition.

## Background

Beginning in 1525 the Zurich church, under Zwingli’s leadership began work on a translation of the Bible into German for the people. Luther’s New Testament was widely used, but the language was difficult for the Swiss to understand as they spoke Alemannic, a form of German significantly different from Luther’s Saxon dialect. Some efforts had been made to accommodate Luther’s translation for the Swiss, but the goal was to prepare a Bible in their native tongue. Work began in June 1525 with the founding of the Prophezei in the Grossmünster in Zurich. Almost every day of the week, Zwingli and his colleagues would gather to work on the books of the Old Testament, beginning with Genesis. The biblical texts were read in Hebrew, Greek (Septuagint), and Latin (Vulgate) and interpreted by the Zurich scholars. The sessions were intended to be open to the clergy, but as they were in Latin only a few could attend. The work of the Prophezei was to serve the church, and to that end at the end of each meeting Zwingli’s close friend, Leo Jud, would take the fruits of the work and deliver them in a German sermon. 

The preparation of a Swiss German Bible took many years, culminating in the Zurich Bible of 1531, the first complete translation into German of the whole Bible. It appeared three years before Luther’s German Bible of 1534. Parts of the new translation were printed in advance. In March 1529, the printer Froschauer produced the Prophets Bible (Prophetenbibel), a new translation of the prophetic books of the Old Testament. 

The publication of the Prophetenbibel was a hurried response to the appearance in 1527 of the *Alle Propheten / nach Hebraischer sprach verteutschet*, printed in Worms and which became known as the Wormser Prophets. It was the work of two highly accomplished translators, Ludwig Hätzer and Hans Denck, who had been assisted by Jewish rabbis. The translation was much admired, including by Zwingli and Luther, although they were appalled by Hätzer and Denck’s radical, possibly Anabaptist, views. Their book sold well and was frequently reprinted, including in Basel and Zurich by Froschauer. 

Indeed Zwingli and his colleagues made extensive use of the Wormser Prophets in preparing their translation of the prophetic books. Research has shown that whole passages were lifted for use in the Zurich translation. Even where the Zurichers provided their own translations, clearly the Wormser Prophets was extensively consulted. Another reason was haste. The printer Froschauer wanted the Zurich translation to be available for the Frankfurt Book Fair in 1529 and that put huge pressure on the scholars. As a result, they relied heavily on the work of Hätzer and Denck. 

The Prophetenbibel appeared in two forms in 1529. The first was a folio edition that included the prophets together with the books of the Apocrypha and a German New Testament. The second was a much smaller octavo edition with only the translations of the prophets. The difference was not just size. The folio edition contained the text is Swiss German and was intended primarily for the clergy for study and preaching. The octavo was written in the German of the Upper Rhine, signaling its intended readership in German lands. Neither edition was reprinted. The Prophetenbibel was a first step towards the complete Bible that appeared two years later.

## Note on authorship

The author of the preface to the Prophetenbibel is not named, clearly signally that book was to demonstrate the collective work of the Zurich scholars. Nevertheless, it is clear that it was the work of Zwingli.

A Foreword to the Prophets (1529)

Grace, mercy, and peace from God, our Father, through Christ Jesus, our Lord [cf. Romans 1:7; 1 Timothy 1:2; 2 Timothy 1:2], we, the servants of the Gospel in the city of Zurich, wish and pray for all the faithful and devout.

Having for several years now diligently read the books of the Old Testament in public, carefully comparing the languages against each other, we have been strongly urged and repeatedly requested by many faithful and well-meaning believers to publish our German translation of the Prophets in print—since these books have been the most sought-after by many.
Although undertaking this task has been burdensome and difficult, after much deliberation and repeated pleas, we have finally agreed to it. First, because it would be unjust to reject the earnest requests of believers [cf. Sirach 4:4]. Secondly, because we ought not to bury the talent that our Lord God has entrusted to us [cf. Matthew 25:18], but rather use our gifts for His glory and for the benefit of the whole Church of Christ.

Although a translation of the Prophets had already been published before, many simple and sincere believers were troubled by it, since it was produced by the Anabaptists. Though this earlier translation was, in many places, faithfully and carefully rendered according to the Hebrew text, who would not shudder and recoil from a translation that came from the very leaders of sects and factions—those who, to this very day, have caused more unrest in the Church of God than even the Papacy itself ever did?

Among these sects, some deny that Christ Jesus is true God, while others proclaim the devil and the ungodly as saved, whereas they assign damnation to those who laugh even slightly. They teach disobedience to authority and promote actions that reveal their doctrine is far removed from Christ. Their hypocrisy knows no bounds, for they pretend to be more righteous than all others, while in reality, they are false in their piety and self-serving in all things.

Who could trust that such men have faithfully handled the passages in the Prophets that speak of Christ, the sustainer of the world [cf. Colossians 1:17], as true God and true man? How could one expect honest treatment of these prophecies from those who deny Christ’s divinity and reject that He has fully atoned for and paid for all human sin? And if anyone should argue that the Prophets have already been translated many years ago, we respond: Yes, indeed, and we do not despise anyone’s translation. However, when it comes to the nature of the language, the structure of speech, and the understanding of meaning, no one can deny that many passages have not been examined deeply enough. Who is so careful, so learned, and so well-informed that he never overlooks, misses, or errs?

Since even prophecy itself can sometimes have flaws and imperfections [cf. 1 Corinthians 11:18], how then could there be no errors in translation?
The gifts of the Spirit are diverse and distinct [cf. 1 Corinthians 12:4-6], and just as one star outshines another in brightness, so too, within the Church of Christ, one person surpasses another in understanding, knowledge, and discernment. If we all, in our actions and teachings, sought only to please our Lord God, whose servants we are—if we pursued only His honor and the benefit of our neighbors, rather than our own advantage and glory—then we would never be angered or take offense when another person presents a matter better and more clearly than we do. Far less would we engage in quarrels with them—yet, unfortunately, we see much of this happening today. Does not Paul say: "If a prophet speaks and another receives revelation from God, the first should remain silent and listen" [cf. 1 Corinthians 14:30]? Likewise, "The others should judge what is said" [cf. 1 Corinthians 14:29].

With this in mind, we bring forth what God has revealed to us in understanding the Scriptures for the benefit of the Church. We do not do this to reject or criticize the work of others, but rather we thank, praise, and pray for God to reward all those who have worked faithfully in Latin or German to translate the Prophets. Far be it from us to suppress or diminish anyone’s honor or labor!

We do not bring forth this work to challenge scholars and the learned with our humble efforts, but rather to encourage those who diligently study and search the Scriptures to deepen their efforts. If, through ignorance (for we are not aware of any dishonesty or deceit in ourselves), we have made mistakes or misunderstood the meaning, we encourage others to bring forth what is better and clearer.

For our understanding of Scripture is like our eyesight in relation to the brightness of the sun: Some have sharper vision than others, but no one can fully grasp everything perfectly.
No one can rightly interpret and understand the Prophets unless they have as their light and guide the Spirit by whom the Prophets themselves were inspired to speak and write.

Yet, the one who has received the Spirit more clearly should not despise the one who has it less clearly. Likewise, the one who has not reached the higher clarity of the Spirit should not reject the one who has been given such insight. Instead, each should faithfully share what has been entrusted to them by God for the benefit of the whole congregation and the entire body of Christ [cf. 1 Corinthians 12:7].

Consider the poor widow in the Gospel—though she gave only two small coins to the temple treasury, Christ praised her more than others [cf. Mark 12:42-44; Luke 21:2-4].
So let everyone bring willingly and faithfully what God has given them for the building of God’s temple, without arrogance or envy.

Whoever digs for treasure must not be deterred by hard labor. Just as many silver mines exist, yet some produce more than others, so too should everyone work diligently to purify the silver of Scripture from the dross of human understanding [cf. Psalm 66:10; 1 Corinthians 3:12]. Just as Isaac reopened the wells that had been clogged by the Philistines [cf. Genesis 26:15], 
so too must the pure streams of Scripture be uncovered and drawn forth once again.
Since we, too, are counted among those whom God has called to this labor, we bring forth what God has given us. Let the Church of God be the judge of it [cf. 1 Corinthians 14:29]. If there is any shortcoming or lack of clarity in our work, we humbly ask and encourage all faithful believers to point it out to us—whether publicly or privately—in brotherly trust and honesty.

We say this not to boast as if we surpass others or to despise anyone’s work, but rather to counter some ill-willed and unfair criticism from those who do not care about what is true and just, but only about what serves their own interests. They believe that if a work is not initiated by them, it should not be accepted by anyone. Such arrogance and contentiousness stem from self-love, fleshly temptation, and excessive ambition.

Since nothing is more characteristic of humanity than error and mistake [cf. James 3:2], we find it necessary to explain, as briefly as possible, to the Christian reader why, in this translation, we have often departed significantly from previous versions, both in words and in meaning.
There are many Hebrew words which, when translated into German, lose their power and richness, their beauty and depth, or cannot be adequately expressed. In order to ensure that the meaning of the original language in which the Prophets wrote is clearly conveyed, we have at times substituted different words that better express the Hebrew sense in a way that is understandable to German readers.

In some instances, we have added small words that do not appear in the Hebrew text, but only when such additions were necessary for the German to be intelligible. Where we have added such words, we have (unless unintentionally omitted) printed them in smaller letters, so that the reader can clearly see what we have inserted. We have done this not to pass off our additions as the Word of God, nor to alter or falsify God’s Word [cf. Deuteronomy 4:2; 2 Corinthians 4:2]. Rather, such insertions are neither distortions nor falsifications, but a necessary part of any faithful translation.

All faithful and understanding readers will recognize that any true translator must render one language into another in such a way that the meaning remains clear—so that no further explanation is required beyond the translation itself. Those who insist on a literal, word-for-word rendering of the Hebrew text often produce a translation so rigid that a reader cannot tell whether it is German or a foreign language.

Since no language on earth can be translated into another in a completely perfect and seamless manner, a translator must focus more on conveying the meaning than on rigidly adhering to the exact wording. To illustrate this, we now provide examples to clarify our approach and, in doing so, also explain the nature of prophecy and the role of the prophet.
The title in Isaiah is commonly translated literally from the Hebrew as:
“This is the vision of Isaiah, the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem” [cf. Isaiah 1:1]. This is a faithful translation according to the Hebrew wording, since hazon means “vision” in Hebrew.

However, for a German reader, the word “vision” (Gesicht) may cause confusion—does it refer to: Physical eyesight? The appearance of something? A supernatural revelation?
Since the German word “Gesicht” can mean all these things, we have replaced it with “prophecy”, and instead of “saw” (gesähen), we have used “prophesied” (prophetieren).

We would not have made this change if the word “Gesicht” were as clearly understood among Germans as hazon is among the Hebrews. For the Hebrews, hazon means a supernatural revelation, in which something is shown in a vision. For example: Jeremiah saw in a vision a branch of an almond tree and a boiling pot [cf. Jeremiah 1:11,13]. Peter saw in a vision a sheet descending from heaven, full of unclean animals [cf. Acts 10:11-12].

Furthermore, hazon can also refer to an inner enlightenment of the mind and a clear revelation from God, without an external vision. For instance, God inspired David inwardly to prepare wood and other materials for the building of the Temple, though there was no external vision [cf. 2 Samuel 7]. Thus, we have adapted our translation not to distort the text, but to make its meaning clearer for German readers.

If we Germans understood the word "Gesicht" (vision) in all the same ways that the Hebrews understand their word "Hazon", we would have translated it as such. However, because the term "Gesicht" does not fully capture the nature, character, and complete meaning of Isaiah’s preaching, we have instead used the word "prophecy."
This is because "prophecy" has a broader and deeper meaning than simply "vision." First, 
the word "prophecy" can refer to the interpretation of God’s Word, as seen in 1 Corinthians 14:1, 3, 4.

First, when someone reads the Word of God, which has been spoken through the Spirit of God, and then interprets, explains, and clarifies it in order to guide people toward God, correct their conduct, and improve their lives, this is a form of prophecy. Secondly, "Prophecy" can also mean foretelling future events, as when the prophets promised comfort, help, and salvation from God to the faithful [cf. Isaiah 40:1-2]. At the same time, they also warned the wicked and godless of destruction and eternal punishment [cf. Isaiah 1:4, 24].
Thirdly, the word "prophetieren" (to prophesy) also means to receive divine messages, deliver warnings, or announce God’s promises, as we see in 1 Corinthians 11:2; 14:3 Amos 3:1, 13; and Luke 2:25-26, 34-35.

To summarize all these aspects in one definition: Prophecy or prophesying is an office that involves declaring God’s commandments and will with faithfulness and true belief, and making it understandable.

Thus, when we say: "This is the prophecy of Isaiah, which he prophesied and proclaimed" [cf. Isaiah 1:1], it means the same as: "These are the sermons, words, and entire mission of the prophet Isaiah—how faithfully he watched over God’s flock, how steadfastly and bravely he warned them, and how sternly he rebuked and punished their sins."

Now that we understand what prophecy and prophesying are, it is easier to grasp what a prophet is. To show the importance of the prophetic office, we must go further in discussing prophets.
When a prophet interprets God’s Word or predicts future events, he must derive his message either from divine revelation or from a deep and true understanding of God’s law: Divine revelation can occur through: Inward inspiration of the spirit; Angelic communication; A divine voice; A vision or appearance; A dream; Something previously revealed.  Alternatively, a true and thorough understanding of God’s Word enables one to prophesy. 

Whoever rightly understands God’s Word can easily: Warn the wicked and rebellious of the punishment that will come upon them; Proclaim to the faithful and God-fearing the goodness and rewards that await them. Above all, a prophet must possess a firm, unwavering faith that the divine message, vision, inspiration, or law comes solely from God. He must trust in it completely, without doubt or hesitation. For example, suppose an angel speaks to a person—that person must not believe it unless he knows beyond all doubt that it is truly the voice of God.

If an angel were to speak to a man, that man should not trust it unless he knew for certain and without doubt that it was truly the voice of God. Likewise, if someone were able to recite the entire Law of God from memory—if he had, as people say, “eaten it up”—yet if he were not inwardly enlightened by the Spirit of God and made certain that the Law is truly God's Word and a revelation of His will, then it would be of no true benefit to him. Moreover, if he were not inwardly set aflame by the same Spirit, filled with zeal and burning desire to follow God's Law and His will, then he would never take a stand against the transgressors of the Law, put himself in danger for God's sake, or patiently and joyfully endure fortune and misfortune alike.
Abraham believed the voice that commanded him to sacrifice his beloved son [cf. Genesis 22:2]. Yet he had previously received a promise from God that through his son Isaac, his offspring would be multiplied and blessed [cf. Genesis 17:16,19]. How, then, could he believe the voice that commanded him to kill the very son in whom the hope of his descendants rested? It was because he was completely certain that the voice was truly God's command. But where did such unshakable certainty come from? It came from his trust and faith in God [cf. Genesis 15:6]. Yet, is such firm and unwavering faith the result of human strength or divine power? Surely not from human strength! If faith were merely a human effort, then there would be no one greater than Abraham in belief and trust.

Now consider Jeroboam. When the prophet from Judah came to Bethel by God’s command and proclaimed that the altar would be split apart and its ashes scattered, Jeroboam did not believe that it was truly God's voice and warning [cf. 1 Kings 13:1-4]. Even when he saw it happen exactly as the prophet had spoken, he still refused to acknowledge it as God's voice. Even when his arm withered and was later restored through the prophet's intercession, he still refused to recognize God's warning and repent [cf. 1 Kings 13:3,33].

This shows that true understanding of the Law of God requires strong faith. We learn this from the following examples.

The two faithful kings, Hezekiah and Josiah, diligently searched and examined God's Law and held firmly to their faith—so firmly that they were completely certain that whatever was written in the Law was God's will and pleasure [cf. 2 Kings 18:5-6; 22:12-13]. They were also inwardly set ablaze, filled with zeal and passion to carry out, uphold, and advance everything God commanded and to eliminate whatever God had forbidden.

If they had not possessed such firm and unwavering faith in God's Word, they would have acted like the priests, scribes, and hypocrites, who boasted of their knowledge of God's Law yet did not pursue true innocence and righteousness in their lives—thinking instead that it was enough to speak cleverly and sweetly about the Law [cf. Matthew 23:2-3]. Why was this so? They lacked the certainty of faith. These kings, however, examined themselves carefully and took every possible measure to ensure that all people lived according to God’s Law, worked to see that the Law was upheld by everyone, and destroyed and punished everything that was contrary to or opposed to it [cf. 2 Chronicles 29-31; 2 Kings 23].

Another example: John the Baptist, when he saw that the godless king had taken his brother’s wife against the law of God, went to him with firm and unwavering faith, which he had in God's law, and told him that it was against God's command for him to have his brother's wife [cf. Matthew 14:3-4; Mark 6:18]. Did not the other priests and scribes also see this? Yes. Why, then, did none of them dare to rebuke him? No one among them had such fear of God in his heart that he would feel horror and disapproval at such a shameful act, or that he would be willing to stand against such wickedness like an iron wall [cf. Jeremiah 1:18].

In times past, false prophets ran about proclaiming peace and prosperity to everyone [cf. Jeremiah 23:17], but they did so not out of true faith and trust in God. Rather, they entered into such an office on their own initiative, without being called or commanded by God [cf. Jeremiah 23:21]. Now, we are all inclined to believe that whoever announces peace to us must be sent by God, even though Christ, the Prince of Peace [cf. Isaiah 9:5], says that he did not come to bring peace but a sword [cf. Matthew 10:34]. There are, in fact, two kinds of peace: one that can exist with God, and another that is merely the peace of the world. But whoever has peace with the world must be in conflict with God.

This is why the false prophets, since they spoke what people liked to hear, were honored and held in high esteem, while the true and faithful prophets were despised and put to death [cf. Matthew 23:24-25]. The foolish people did not realize that God had something else in store for them. If the prophets had true fear of God and firm faith, they would have found in God's law what they were supposed to preach. Since they saw that the life of the Jewish people was godless, rebellious, wicked, and filled to the highest degree with all manner of sins, they should not have proclaimed peace, but rather the sword, famine, death, and similar punishments upon the people [cf. Revelation 6:3-8].

These are the preachers whom Paul calls "puffed up," those who presented themselves as learned among the Corinthians, yet did not rebuke the one who sinned so openly and shamelessly [cf. 1 Corinthians 5:1-2]. Why? Because they did not want to anger anyone, so that they could continue to enjoy their privileges. If they had true faithfulness and firm belief, they would have feared to anger God rather than to anger men.

We are concerned that there are far too many such prophets, preachers, and bishops today, especially in great cities and princely courts, who preach the gospel of Christ crucified [cf. 1 Corinthians 1:23; 2:2]—but without the cross. They are eloquent and speak well, they can skillfully discuss God's Word, but when it comes to attacking and denouncing usury and greed, the violent tyranny of arrogant nobility, excessive power, wars, taking pensions, bloodshed, treachery, corruption of justice and law, counterfeit money, dishonest weights and measures, land speculation, and monopolies that harm the common people—against such sins, they remain silent, like mute dogs [cf. Isaiah 56:10]. What is the cause of this?

That they are not faithful to their Lord God; they are mere book preachers and, as Paul calls them, enemies of the cross of Christ [cf. Philippians 3:18-19]. They are not concerned with the righteousness and innocence of the people, but rather with being regarded as learned and held in high esteem. If it were the case that preachers should say only what the people wish to hear, then there would be no need for prophets in the congregation of God; one might as well set up a lute player or a bagpiper, for such would be well received by all and would offend no one [cf. Sirach 40:21]. But God has called His prophets and apostles salt [cf. Matthew 5:13], so that they may be sharp, biting away at sin and preventing future corruption. He has called them a light [cf. Matthew 5:14], so that they may shine and illuminate those dwelling in the house of God. He has appointed them over nations and kingdoms, that they may tear down, destroy, and uproot all that stands against God, and that they may build up, plant, and establish [cf. Jeremiah 1:10] whatever God wills: righteousness, innocence, faithfulness, love, and justice among men. Where this salt is lacking, everything rots daily; where this light does not shine, deep darkness grows; where these faithful shepherds are absent, the wolf ravages and scatters the flock of God [cf. Acts 20:29].
In this, we see the fatherly faithfulness and care of God for the human race, in that from the beginning of the world He has always sent forth messengers and admonishers [cf. Hebrews 1:1], urging the people away from vice and toward righteousness, faithfulness, and truth. Even among the heathens, He raised up such men who, in their devotion, spoke courageously in their communities so that the people would turn away from sin and be led toward virtue. Many such figures can be found among the Greeks and Romans, as history attests. Thus, God does not desire that anyone should go astray; He has allowed the radiance of His light, that is, His truth, to shine even among the pagans. But above all, among His own people, that is, the Jewish nation, He continually gave them prophets—those who admonished and rebuked—until in these last days, because of their greatest sin, they were rejected by God.

It has always been the case that whenever people were wholly and utterly immersed in wickedness, corruption, and every kind of wantonness, they still wished to appear righteous. They sought to justify their evil and wrongdoing through hypocrisy, attempting to make it appear good and just. They sought to achieve this through two means: false reverence for God and cunning, eloquent speech. By means of false, fabricated piety and outward devotion, they sought to present themselves before everyone as true servants of God, as those who loved, feared, and honored Him. By means of sweet, pleasant, and artful speech, they sought to sell themselves to the common people as learned men.

Against these two harmful vices, God has set forth true reverence and devotion to Him, as well as true wisdom and eloquence. This means that, out of His goodness, God has always raised up and prepared men who had true faith and fear of God in their hearts, as well as true knowledge, teaching, and bold speech in their mouths, so that they might easily expose and shame hypocrisy. For false faith cannot conceal itself before true faith, and empty rhetoric cannot stand before those who are truly instructed in God's Word and Spirit. It is for this purpose that God has raised up and sent forth His prophets, so that they may expose and reveal all falsehood and hypocrisy and wage an eternal struggle against sin.

Thus much about the prophetic office.

This is an example of why a translator must, depending on the nature and structure of the language, sometimes substitute one word for another.

Now, we also want to briefly explain how a translator may at times add a word for the sake of clarity of meaning, even if it is not present in the original text, or at times remove a word that is in the text. In the first chapter of Isaiah, the Hebrew reads: "Every head is sick, every heart is weak; from the sole of the foot to the head, there is no soundness in it" [Isaiah 1:5-6]. This is quite obscure, so we have modified and added certain words for the sake of clearer understanding, without which the meaning would not be evident. Here, the Lord, through the prophet, reproaches the Jewish people, stating that from the highest to the lowest, from rulers to the common people, they were utterly corrupt. The prophet expresses this with the striking image of a body that is entirely sick and wounded from the soles of the feet to the top of the head. By "head," he refers to the kings, prophets, and all those in authority; by "body," the congregation; by "feet," the lowest members of society. To make this clearer, we have translated: "The whole head is sick, and the heart utterly sorrowful; from the sole of the foot to the head, there is nothing healthy in your whole body." Here, we have added "in your whole body" to clarify the metaphor, whereas the Hebrew simply says "in it."

At the end of the first chapter of Isaiah, the Hebrew reads: "And as a garden in which the water is not in it" [Isaiah 1:30]. In Hebrew, this is a well-formed, elegant, and understandable phrase, but when translated into German, it becomes unnatural, unpleasant, and unclear. Therefore, we have translated it as: "Like a garden that has no moisture." Here, we have omitted some words and added others. We left out "in it" because it is unnecessary in our language and makes the sentence less clear. We added "has" since the Hebrew does not include it, but without this word, the German sentence would sound rough and entirely foreign. However, as far as the meaning is concerned, we have changed nothing.

In the second chapter of Isaiah, the Hebrew reads: "O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the Lord" [Isaiah 2:5]. To make this clearer, we have added: "I call to you, O house of Jacob." Here, the prophet abruptly shifts his speech away from the Gentiles, about whom he had previously spoken, and turns to the Jews, calling to them and reproaching them sternly but fatherly. He urges them toward great blessedness and toward the great light, admonishing them to walk in it. This sudden transition from addressing the Gentiles to addressing the Jews has no distinct marker in Hebrew; therefore, we have added "I call to you here" to make the meaning clear to every reader. Similarly, we have made such modifications in many other places where necessary. Sometimes, where required by the sense of the passage, we have changed personal pronouns to clarify the reference in the prophetic text. For we believe it is the duty of a faithful translator to bring forth the meaning clearly and understandably. If this can be achieved without changing the words, allowing them to flow naturally from one language into another, that is a great advantage. However, when the words resist such a transition and cannot be smoothly and appropriately rendered into another language, then it is the translator’s responsibility to use appropriate words that convey the intended meaning. It would be a foolish and clumsy approach to cling rigidly to the words and thereby lose or obscure the meaning.

A little further on, in the second chapter, the Hebrew reads: "Go into the rock and hide yourself from the fear of the Lord" [Isaiah 2:10]. Here, instead of simply "Go," we have translated it as "Get yourself quickly to safety," because the urgency of the prophet's words and the gravity of the matter require it. It is much more vivid to say, "And therefore, get yourself quickly to safety" than merely to say, "Go into a rock." That is why we have added "And therefore" as well as "quickly," since these words provide clarity and emphasis to the meaning.
Similarly, where the Hebrew says, "from the fear of the Lord," we have translated: "from the terrifying judgment," changing "Lord" to "judge." The prophet is speaking here of God's punishment and wrath that will come upon the ungodly. In German, the word "judge" conveys a much stronger sense of fear than simply "Lord," yet both words refer only to God. Likewise, we have changed "fear" to "terrifying," as it sounds more natural in German. A little further on, in the same chapter, the Hebrew reads: "The eyes of the arrogant will be humbled, the pride of men will be brought low, and the Lord alone will be exalted on that day" [Isaiah 2:11].

Here, we have replaced the word "Lord" with "he" because, in Hebrew and in many other places, the relative pronouns referring back to a noun are often used in place of the proper name. For example, if one says, "The Lord God alone is wise, and to Him alone belongs all honor," it is clear that "Him" refers to the previously mentioned Lord God. This phrasing is more elegant and concise than saying, "The Lord is alone wise, and to the Lord alone belongs all honor," even though the meaning remains entirely the same. However, the wording in the first sentence is both more pleasant and shorter than in the second.

In the eleventh chapter of Zechariah, the Hebrew reads: "So the covenant was broken that I had made with all the peoples" [Zechariah 11:10]. Here, we have replaced "peoples" with "tribes" because, in our understanding, the prophet is not referring to a covenant made with the Gentiles, but rather to the one made with the tribes of Israel. Similarly, shortly thereafter, the Hebrew text reads: "If it seems good in your eyes, then give me my wages" [Zechariah 11:12]. We have translated this as: "Does it seem good to you?" or "Do you find it fitting?" While the Hebrews phrase it as "Is it good in your eyes," such an expression is uncommon and unfamiliar in German. With all these examples, we have sought to demonstrate that we have not deviated from the old interpretation without reason. We have neither added, removed [cf. Deuteronomy 4:2], nor altered any words without having clear justification grounded in faith and Scripture.
A discerning, faithful, and God-fearing reader who compares the old German with our translation will easily recognize and understand this. We have paid little attention to the punctuation, verse divisions, and other additions introduced by the Jewish rabbis, as these were only added in recent years and thus do not determine the true meaning and essence of the words.

Regarding allegories, that is, figurative language, which fills all the prophetic books, we thought it necessary to caution and warn the reader. Many people approach these texts in entirely misguided ways. Some impose allegories onto everything according to their own desires and inclinations. To them, the manger in which Christ was laid must represent the Church, while the swaddling clothes in which He was wrapped [cf. Luke 2:7] must symbolize the Holy Scriptures. To them, the heavens in the eighth Psalm [cf. Psalm 8:2] must represent the apostles. However, David in this passage is doing nothing more than contemplating the heavenly and earthly creation, which moves him to praise and give thanks to God.

By saying this, we do not deny that "heavens" can sometimes be used in Scripture to refer to great, enlightened, and spiritually rich people. But in this particular passage, we reject such an interpretation. David’s meaning here is: "O Lord, how great and wondrous is Your power, might, and majesty throughout the whole earth! Yes, Your praise, glory, and honor reach even to the heavens." (This is a rhetorical flourish.) "When I lift my eyes to the heavens and see the sun, moon, and stars—indeed, when I consider all the works of Your hands—and then turn my gaze back to the earth, I find that You have bestowed upon man a dignity far above all these things."
What need is there to force a theological interpretation onto "heavens" here? And what, then, should we do with the oxen, sheep, and other animals mentioned in the same passage [cf. Psalm 8:9]?

Some people reject all allegories and figures of speech, insisting on interpreting everything the prophets foretold in a literal and material sense, much like the Jews. They believe that Israel will return to its land, that the earthly Jerusalem will be rebuilt, that physical freedom will be restored, that all people on earth will live in harmony with no evil remaining, and many other misguided ideas.

This misconception arises from a failure to understand that the prophets often used familiar, tangible language while referring to something far higher and more profound than the words themselves might initially suggest. Some, either failing to notice this or not understanding it, insist on interpreting everything literally, just as the Jews do in their purely materialistic interpretation. This kind of teaching is not a minor cause of unrest, for what else would the common people desire but rebellion when they hear nothing but the promise of earthly freedom?
Therefore, we have sought to warn all faithful hearts not to be led astray by such deceptive and false interpretations, but rather to read the prophets with a pure and sincere perspective, with simple and uncorrupted hearts. There they will find God's goodness, mercy, and grace extended to all who love and fear Him, as well as His righteousness, wrath, and punishment against all who turn away from Him in unfaithfulness. They will see His true warnings to sinners, His stern rebukes against the wicked and all forms of deceit.

Furthermore, they will understand that God does not overlook the hardened who refuse to repent and amend their ways but rather punishes and uproots them, whether they be Gentiles or Jews. We have ample examples of this in Israel and Judah, whom God, after countless acts of kindness and despite their immense ingratitude and unfaithfulness, after repeated warnings from the prophets, utterly destroyed and cast away from His fatherly care when their wickedness continued to grow. However, for the sake of the blessed and salvific seed that was to be born from them, God always allowed a remnant to survive [cf. Isaiah 1:9; Romans 9:29], with whom He would ultimately be reconciled.

In the meantime, by His grace and not by our merit, God has accepted the Gentiles in place of the Jews [cf. Isaiah 65:1; Romans 9:25-26] and made them heirs [cf. Ephesians 1:11], about whom the prophets spoke extensively. Hence, all the promises of land, peace, joy, and happiness given to Israel, Judah, Zion, and Jerusalem should not be understood as material prosperity (for the kingdom of Christ is not of this world [cf. John 18:36]) but rather as representations of spiritual joy, peace, and tranquility of conscience, which we have received through Christ.
By "Judah" and "Israel," we should understand Christ, since He was born from Judah, and also those from Israel and Judah who believed in Him or will come to believe, such as the apostles and others. Additionally, it refers to those Gentiles who have been accepted in place of Israel, who now constitute the true Judah, the true Israel, and the seed of Abraham, as Paul clearly affirms in Romans, chapters 2, 4, and 9 [cf. Romans 2:14-15, 29; 4:11, 16; 9:24].

Likewise, by "Jerusalem" and "Zion," we understand the Church and the people of Christ spread throughout the world, as stated in Galatians 4 [cf. Gal. 4:26, 31]. It is true that many prophecies in the Old Testament refer to events that physically occurred to the Jews in their land, such as their return from Babylonian captivity and their rebuilding of the temple and the city [cf. e.g., Isa. 45:13]. Nevertheless, the wording of these prophecies is always such that any spiritually minded person can recognize that the prophets intended to convey something far greater and more profound through these earthly events. Indeed, there are always certain phrases that serve as clear indicators that the prophets are speaking not only of physical realities but also of spiritual and eternal matters. These are things that the fleshly-minded Jews never attained and never will.

Some of these prophecies were fulfilled in the believing Jews during the time of Christ and the apostles, as well as in the Israel that was gathered from the Gentiles, while others will be fulfilled in due time when God grants grace to the remnant of the Jewish people. To provide a small example of this (for who could list them all here?), consider the passage in Haggai, chapter 2, where God says that the glory of the latter temple will be greater than that of the former [cf. Hag. 2:7-9]. If this were to be understood as referring to the physical temple, then it would contradict the statement that God makes just before, where He says that anyone who saw the first temple in its magnificence must acknowledge that the second is as nothing compared to the first [Hag. 2:3].

Thus, we hear clearly that God is speaking of a different kind of temple than the physical one, contrary to what the Jews and even some among us would like to believe. Furthermore, the Lord declares that He will establish lasting peace in that place [cf. Hag. 2:9]. But when did the Jews ever have peace in Jerusalem? Moreover, when did the Jews ever possess and subjugate the lands and nations promised to them by the prophets? If they now claim that these things will still come to pass—that they will regain their earthly land, possess it, and rule over it in peace—this is nothing but a carnal thought and a false hope with which they deceive themselves.
Therefore, as we have previously mentioned, it is essential to recognize the use of allegories, anagogies, catagogies, and similar rhetorical figures in the prophets. An allegory is a form of speech in which something is presented in a different form than the words themselves might suggest. However, allegorical language is always constructed in such a way that one can discern the truth through it, as if seeing an image in a mirror [cf. 1 Cor. 13:12].
For example, in the Book of Acts, chapter 20, Paul speaks to the elders of the church in Ephesus, saying: "Take heed to yourselves and to the whole flock, over which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the Church of God" [Acts 20:28]. This is an allegory—a figurative way of speaking. He calls them "shepherds" but means pastors, and he refers to the "flock" or "sheep," but he is actually speaking of the Christian people. Nevertheless, he includes a clarifying phrase, like a candle that illuminates and makes clear that he is referring to the pastoral office—namely, the words "Take heed and be diligent."

Similarly, when he says, "You are overseers to shepherd the Church of God," this is figurative language. But the word "Church" makes it clear that he is not literally speaking about sheep, even though he calls them that, but about believing people. In John 10, Christ speaks about the office and faithfulness of the shepherd and the sheep, but He refers to Himself as the shepherd and to all believers as the sheep [cf. John 10:2-4, 11-14, 27-29]. Just as I have shown in these two examples, so it should be understood in all other cases.

This also makes it clear that the Hebrews often use a word differently depending on the context. For example, when they speak of the "day of the Lord" or the "last day," they sometimes mean the death of each individual; sometimes they refer to the time of divine punishment and wrath, which God executes daily upon us; sometimes they mean the final day of universal judgment and God's verdict, as when Christ says in John 6: "Whoever sees the Son and believes in Him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day" [John 6:40]. Here, the "last day" refers to the death of each believer, for Christ promises to preserve in life those who trust in Him, regardless of the day they die. He also says in John 5 that those who believe in Him do not come into condemnation but have already passed from death to life [cf. John 5:24].

Likewise, when Martha says she believes that her brother Lazarus will rise again on the last day [cf. John 11:24], she understands this as the final day of universal resurrection. In 1 Corinthians 3, Paul speaks of the "day of the Lord" revealing everything, which will be tested by fire [cf. 1 Cor. 3:13], taking "day" to mean a time of tribulation and trial. Since the "day of the Lord" or the "last day" always refers to God's coming to punish sin—whether in the sense of His judgment upon certain nations, lands, and kingdoms, or in the ultimate sense of the final judgment upon the entire world—the prophetic references to the "day of the Lord" are to be understood in different ways depending on the context.

Similarly, the resurrection of the dead can be understood in different ways. Sometimes it refers to the life after this present life, as in Hebrews 6 [cf. Heb. 6:12]. Sometimes it means the final resurrection of bodies, as in 1 Corinthians 15 [cf. 1 Cor. 15:52-54]. Sometimes "resurrection of the flesh" is used to refer to the common judgment of all mankind, as Isaiah says: "All flesh shall see the salvation of God" [cf. Isa. 40:5; 52:10]. Since not all people accept Christ in this life, "flesh" here refers to humanity. At other times, however, the "resurrection of the flesh" refers specifically to the resurrection of bodies.

Similarly, the word "judgment" is also used in different ways. From this arises our understanding of "anagogical" and "katagogical" interpretations. An "anagogy" is an elevated speech, where one begins with an earthly reference—such as Jerusalem, the physical city—and then lifts the meaning to refer to the heavenly Jerusalem. In contrast, a "katagogy" is a descending or lowering form of speech, as when Isaiah speaks of the fall of Lucifer, which was commonly believed by the Jews, and then shifts downward to refer to the fall of the king of Babylon [cf. Isa. 14:12]. Thus, when one ascends from the earthly to the heavenly, it is called an "anagogy"; when one descends from the higher to the lower, it is a "katagogy." The misunderstanding of these concepts has led to many erroneous and nonsensical interpretations of Scripture. People fail to recognize that the Hebrew language frequently shifts between elevated and ordinary meanings, sometimes speaking in general terms, sometimes in specific terms, and often within a single sentence.
Furthermore, one must also note that when the New Testament states, "Thus was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophets" [cf. Matt. 1:22 and similar passages], this can be understood in two ways. First, it means that the prophecy of the prophets is fulfilled when what they foretold actually comes to pass. For example, Isaiah says: "Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son" [Isa. 7:14]. This did not happen in the prophet’s time, but he foretold that it would occur in the future. It was fulfilled when Mary gave birth to Christ. That is why Matthew says, "All this happened so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled" [Matt. 1:22], and this is the proper meaning of prophetic fulfillment.
Secondly, a prophecy or Scripture is fulfilled when the prophets or Scriptures speak of an event that truly happened at that time but is later repeated in a different form, so that the historical event itself is not only a past occurrence but also a foreshadowing of something yet to happen. For example, when God led Israel, His beloved son, out of Egypt, this was an actual historical event, as recorded in the Book of Exodus [cf. Ex. 12:51]. However, this event also serves as a foreshadowing of Christ, whom God also called out of Egypt, as Matthew interprets [cf. Matt. 2:15].

But later, God also led Christ, His Son, out of Egypt [cf. Matt. 2:21]. Therefore, Matthew says: "Thus was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet: Out of Egypt I have called My Son" [Matt. 2:15]. Here we see what anagogy is. The prophet Hosea says: "When Israel was young, I loved him, and I called My son out of Egypt" [Hos. 11:1]. The prophet here understands this to refer to the people of Israel, whom God Himself calls His firstborn son, as stated in Exodus 4 [cf. Exod. 4:22]. And from the event concerning the people of Israel, there arises a connection to Christ, who is the natural Son of God and who was also led out of Egypt, just as Israel was in earlier times. Thus, the prophecy is fulfilled when what had happened before happens again.
Another example: When Jacob left Mesopotamia with two wives and great possessions [cf. Gen. 31:17-18], this was an actual historical event, yet at the same time, it was a figure and a sign of a future event—namely, that Christ would be wedded to both the synagogue and the church from among the Gentiles. Therefore, Paul says that all things happened to them as a sign [cf. 1 Cor. 10:6,11]. That is, these physical events truly happened to them, but they nonetheless also signified something that was yet to come. And when that future event occurred, the former was fully and completely fulfilled.

Therefore, O Christian reader (to conclude), read the prophets always with Paul's words in mind, where he says that all things happened to them as a sign to show us something [cf. 1 Cor. 10:6]. Indeed, these things were written for our sake, for those of us living in the last age [cf. 1 Cor. 10:11], so that we might learn never to provoke God, to live piously, innocently, and truthfully, to remain faithful to the true God, to love and thank the gracious Father who has called us out of the number of the children of wrath [cf. Eph. 2:3] to become His children through His beloved Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord. He has grafted us in place of His people from among the Gentiles [cf. Rom. 11:17], so that we might never provoke this faithful God. For if He did not spare the Jews, His beloved people, He will much less spare us if we are ungrateful and unfaithful [cf. Rom. 11:21]. This and similar lessons we should learn from the prophets.

May the Almighty, gracious Father, who through His beloved Son has called us from death to life, grant us His Spirit, true faith, and love, and kindle within us His light, so that in reading the Scriptures we may not go astray but may daily grow in the knowledge and love of God [cf. Phil. 1:9]. Amen.
